GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) [2023] [Dr. Mohammad Javad Parseh]

Everyone is allowed to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                             Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
The GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it also applies to
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
your programs, too.

                             Terms and Conditions

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    Conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy
    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
    intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
    absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
    Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
       whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
       part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
       parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
       when you run, you must cause it, when you start running for such
       interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
       announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
       notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
       a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
       these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
       License. (Exception: if the program itself is interactive but
       does not normally print such an announcement, your work is based on
       the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These are the terms of the GNU General Public License. For more
